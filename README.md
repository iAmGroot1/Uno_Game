# Uno Game
This is an attempt to simulate a real world card game UNO in your beloved desktop :v: The AI built in this is not as
efficient as it should be though its still a work in progress also this game depends on the cards you get thus its  quite challlenging to built an AI. This game was built on the very popular java platform **BLUE-J** link for which is given down below. 

## Installation:
**Few guidelines on how to run the game:**
- First this programme uses inheritance so you would need to create a seperate class for each or if your using blue-j you can install the jar file and run it.
- For the GUI you will need to install the UnoGame file and need to change the pathway of the file based on your desktop.
For example: The picture givew below show the path based on my computer **_"/home/Rohan...._** what you would need to do is change that to your home directory.

   This process is quite tedious :sweat: as you would require to change the pathway in multiple places a problem which i will soon address and solve.
- The rules on how to play the game too will be uploaded soon.
- If everything works out fine you would see something like this :

   ## Problems you may face:
   - If your screen pixel density is not the same as mine the display of the cards may not come in the center.
   - If you click on any other application while the game is running it minimzes all the contents of the game and you may have to open each one manually.
 
   I guess thats all. This game does have a lot of problems not necessarily bugs :grin: which i will be working on. Any feedback would be appericiated.
